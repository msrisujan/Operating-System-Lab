// Write two programs (Given Lab5Question41.c and Lab5Question42.c).

// For Lab5Question41.c:

// In Parent Process:

// (a) Print your name, roll number, and Institution name 

// (b) Print process id and its parent process id and return value of fork() system call.

 

// In Child Process,

// (a) Print id of the process, itâ€™s parent process id, and return value of fork() system call.

// (b) Use exec() system call to execute new program written in Lab5Question42.c. In Lab5Question42.c, write or compute anything of your choice. The executable file for Lab5Question42.c is (Lab5Question42).

// (c) Write a few printf statements after operation (b).

// Analyze the entire creation of the parent and child processes. Make sure that the parent process terminates after the child process has finished its execution.
